title: RVIC routed Variable Infiltration Capacity with Glaciers (VIC-GL) model output for northwest North America forced with Bias Correction/Constructed Analogue Quantile Mapping version 2.0 (BCCAQ2) downscaling model output
product: routed hydrological model output
type: streamflow drought
long_description: Drought characteristics estimated using the threshold level method. It is based on defining a threshold, Q0, below which the river flow is considered as a drought (also referred to as a low flow spell). Both the beginning and the end of the drought can be defined as well other properties of the distribution of drought deficit (duration, volume, etc.)
method: 'Duration, magnitude and start date of seasonal maximum drought (by magnitude) estimated from time series of drought deficit characteristics (Tallaksen, L. M., H. Madsen, and B. Clausen, 1997: On the definition and modelling of streamflow drought duration and deficit volume. Hydrological Sciences Journal, 42, 15â€“33, https://doi.org/10.1080/02626669709492003)'
